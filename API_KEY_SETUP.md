# 🔐 OpenAI API Key Setup Guide

## Security Best Practices

Your OpenAI API key has been moved from hardcoded values to secure environment-based configuration.

## Setup Options

### Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended for Development)

1. **Set environment variable in Xcode:**
   - Open your project in Xcode
   - Go to Product → Scheme → Edit Scheme
   - Select "Run" → "Arguments" → "Environment Variables"
   - Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY` = `your_actual_api_key_here`

2. **Or set in terminal:**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_actual_api_key_here"
   ```

### Option 2: Info.plist (For Development Only)

1. **Add to Info.plist:**
   - Open `Info.plist` in Xcode
   - Add new key: `OpenAIAPIKey`
   - Set value to your API key

2. **Add to .gitignore:**
   ```gitignore
   # Add this to your .gitignore to prevent committing API keys
   Info.plist
   ```

### Option 3: iOS Keychain (Most Secure - Built-in)

The app now includes a built-in Keychain storage option:

1. **Open the app** and go to Settings
2. **Navigate to "AI & API"** section
3. **Tap "OpenAI API Key"**
4. **Enter your API key** in the secure text field
5. **Tap "Store in Keychain"** to save it securely

The API key will be stored in the iOS Keychain, which is the most secure method available on iOS.

## Production Deployment

For production deployment:

1. **Never commit API keys to version control**
2. **Use environment variables on your server**
3. **Consider using a backend service** to proxy OpenAI requests
4. **Implement API key rotation** for enhanced security

## Current Implementation

The `GPTService` now:
- ✅ Checks environment variables first (most secure for development)
- ✅ Falls back to iOS Keychain (most secure for production)
- ✅ Falls back to Info.plist for development only
- ✅ Validates API key availability
- ✅ Provides clear error messages
- ✅ No hardcoded keys in source code
- ✅ Built-in Keychain management UI
- ✅ Secure storage with iOS Keychain

## Testing

To test if your API key is working:
1. Set up the API key using one of the methods above
2. Run the app and try the AI journal generation feature
3. Check the console for any API key warnings

## Security Notes

- 🔒 API keys are never logged or exposed in console output
- 🔒 Environment variables are the most secure method
- 🔒 Info.plist should only be used for development
- 🔒 Always use .gitignore to prevent accidental commits
